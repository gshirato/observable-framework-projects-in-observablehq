## Principles of Data Mining and Learning Algorithms: Visual Analytics

### Master: MA-INF 4209
---
In this seminar, we will learn skills and knowledge required for Visual Analytics.

**Our goal** is for you to engage in a learning process to explore the importance of these skills through hands-on tasks and active participation.


**Our targets** during the seminar:

- to enable you to find visual representations that facilitate reasoning with data
- to understand computational methods in visualization
- to develop visual interfaces that aid human interpretation of visually represented data, preferably in an interactive manner.

**As preparation for our first meeting,** please find and bring a couple of real-world examples of visual representations, such as charts, that you find effective in interpreting data. Include a brief summary explaining what you think makes these visualizations useful.

**Prerequisite**: a basic understanding of data visualization tools such as [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) (JavaScript) or [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) (Python) is ideal, though familiarity with [Google Spreadsheets](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/resources/trainings/google-sheets-visualizing-data/) is sufficient for participation.

**What you will have to do**: we plan at least one presentation on your development process and a final report on the visual analytics tools you've created. The course will aim to seamlessly blend theoretical concepts with hands-on practice.
